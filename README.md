## Hi there 👋

I'm Leo. a inal-year **Software Engineering student** with a strong interest in **distributed systems**, **backend engineering**, **security**, and applied **AI**.

I focus on building systems that prioritise correctness, reliability, and scalability — with an emphasis on understanding *how things work under the hood*, not just using abstractions.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Distributed systems architecture
- Backend system design
- Data replication & fault tolerance
- Secure file storage and communication
- Foundations of AI-assisted systems

---

## 🚀 Final Year Project

**Distributed File Storage System (Java)**  
A backend-focused system exploring core distributed systems principles, including:

- Secure file chunking and encryption  
- Replication across multiple nodes  
- Fault tolerance and redundancy models  
- Client–server communication design  
- Architectural concepts inspired by RAID and HDFS  

This project serves as both a technical deep dive and a foundation for exploring real-world, scalable backend systems.
