## 🚀 Top Project

**Distributed File Storage System (Java)**  
A backend-focused system exploring core distributed systems principles, including:

- Secure file chunking and encryption  
- Replication across multiple nodes  
- Fault tolerance and redundancy models  
- Client–server communication design  
- Architectural concepts inspired by RAID and HDFS  

This project serves as both a technical deep dive and a foundation for exploring real-world, scalable backend systems.
